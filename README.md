## Highlights
- **Soil moisture time series** can identify irrigation-relevant parameters.
- **Event-based approach** accurately estimates field capacity (FC) and plant extraction limit (PEL).
- **Improved irrigation efficiency** through precise soil moisture monitoring.

## Abstract
Accurate estimation of soil moisture parameters, such as field capacity and permanent wilting point, is essential for improved irrigation management. This study presents a technique for quantifying soil moisture parameters based on the identification of event-based hydrologic signatures in volumetric water content data collected from corn and cotton fields under different irrigation treatments in Virginia during 2020 and 2021.
